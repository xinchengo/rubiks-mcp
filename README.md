## What this is
An MCP server exposing a Rubik’s Cube as a stateful environment
for evaluating LLM sequential reasoning and pattern recognition.

## Why
We want to test whether LLMs can:
- plan multi-step reversible actions
- avoid loops
- reason under partial observability

## Non-goals
- Not a speedcubing solver
- Not a full RL environment
